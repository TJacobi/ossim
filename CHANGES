----------------------------
version1:
----------------------------
- based more significantly on INET: Router, StandardHost
- re-organize folders: two important folders inside src/ are applications/ and nodes/
- paths inside the package were therefore also changed
- applications/ folder contains modules at the application layer (bootstrap/ peer/ tracker/)
- nodes/ folder contains modules for setting up the "hardware" of the host
- BootstrapNode, PeerNode & TrackerNode are all modified from inet.StandardHost
- nodes and router are inter-connected using PPP interface, instead of Ethernet one.
