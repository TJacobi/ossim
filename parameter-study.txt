Setup from [Li-2008]:
Streaming rate: 400Kbps
Block (Chunk) size: 10 Kbits (~ 1250 Bytes)
System size: 5000 nodes
Arrival Process: Poisson (inter-arrival time = 10 msec)

Source node capacity: 9Mbps (max(n_partners) = 15)
Peer node: (max(n_partner) = 20)
- homo: 500Kbps
- Hetero: 100Kbps & 900Kbps

Video buffer = 30 sec




Performance metrics:
We use the following metrics to evaluate the system per-
formance. 

(i) Playback continuity (continuity index): the ratio of the number of blocks that exist in buffer at their playback due time to that of blocks that should have been played over time, which is the main metric for evaluating user satisfaction.

(ii) Out-going (Uploading) bandwidth utilization: a metric for evaluating how efﬁcient the uploading bandwidth capacity is used. 

(iii) Effective data ratio: the percentage of useful data blocks in all the received ones. This metric evaluates how efﬁcient the bandwidth is utilized. 

(iv) Buffer utilization: this measures how the buffer is utilized. 

(v) Startup delay: the waiting time until a node starts playing the video after it joins the system. 

(vi) Path length: the distance between a node and the source in the overlay. This metric characterizes the overlay structure. 

(vii) Partner/parent/child change rate(s): The changes in partners/parents/children per second within a node, which is a metric for evaluating overlay stability.
